For fun, I 
* Play keyboard instruments :musical_keyboard: and compose music :musical_score: for the band [Totemtanz](https://totemtanz.dk).
* Play TTRPGs :game_die:, currently Burning Wheel
* Contribute to open source stuff :open_hands: like the amazing [rinex](https://github.com/georust/rinex) crate or trying to make the [Second Life Viewer](https://github.com/secondlife/viewer) more macOS- happy.

For the latter, I'm currently trying to convert the BOOLs to bools.
