Hello, I'm Lars.

I help distributing open data [@Kortforsyningen](https://github.com/Kortforsyningen) / [@Dataforsyningen](https://github.com/dataforsyningen) for the general public for a living.

I also do other open source stuff, play and compose music, play TTRPGs and read space exploration news.
