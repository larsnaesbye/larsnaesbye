Hi, I'm Lars.

For a living, I make open data [@Kortforsyningen](https://github.com/Kortforsyningen) / [@Dataforsyningen](https://github.com/dataforsyningen) for the general public.

I also do open source, play and compose music, play TTRPGs and read space exploration news.

Motto: Feet on the ground, nose in the sky, heart on the sleeve.
